# SECTION A — Purpose & Positioning

## A1. What is SBM, in simple terms?

SBM (Shunyaya Behavioral Mathematics) is a **deterministic structural mathematics layer** that classifies behavioral evolution of ordered sequences under fixed, replay-verifiable rules.

It does not modify classical mathematics.  
It does not inject probabilistic reasoning.  
It does not perform prediction.

It introduces a **deterministic structural alphabet over evolving systems.**

---

## A2. What problem does SBM address?

Classical mathematics evaluates:

- Numerical correctness  
- Functional relationships  
- Algebraic consistency  

SBM evaluates:

- Structural posture evolution  
- Alphabet state transitions  
- Behavioral stability under deterministic horizon  

SBM governs **structural behavior — not magnitude accuracy.**

---

## A3. Does SBM replace classical mathematics?

No.

SBM is a **conservative extension.**

Structural collapse invariant:

`phi((m,a,s)) = m`

Where:

- `m` = classical magnitude  
- `a` = structural alignment  
- `s` = accumulated structural posture  

Magnitude remains untouched.

---

## A4. Is SBM probabilistic or statistical?

No.

SBM:

- Uses no randomness  
- Uses no probability  
- Uses no statistical thresholds  
- Uses no machine learning  
- Uses no adaptive tuning  

All behavior is **deterministic and replay-verifiable.**

---

# SECTION B — Structural Alphabet Discipline

## B1. What does SBM compute?

Given an ordered observation stream:

`X(t)`

SBM computes a structured state:

`X(t) = (m(t), a(t), s(t))`

Where:

- `m(t)` = classical output  
- `a(t)` = structural alignment metric  
- `s(t)` = accumulated structural posture  

These evolve deterministically under bounded horizon rules.

---

## B2. What is the structural alphabet?

SBM generates a deterministic structural alphabet representing posture transitions.

`Sigma = {sigma_0, ..., sigma_L}`

The alphabet is finite and fully determined by:

- Operator  
- Horizon `H`  
- Deterministic rules  

Alphabet expansion without specification invalidates conformance.

---

## B3. Does SBM use infinite memory?

No.

SBM operates under a bounded horizon:

`H >= 1`

Only:

`W_H(t) = {t-H+1, ..., t}`

is used for structural evaluation.

There is:

- No forecasting  
- No extrapolation  
- No infinite accumulation  

---

# SECTION C — Deterministic Replay Identity

## C1. What does replay identity mean?

Two identical executions must produce:

`B_A = B_B`

Byte-identical artifacts.

---

## C2. What artifacts must match?

- `sbm_results.csv`
- `sbm_alphabet.csv`
- `sbm_metrics.csv`
- `sbm_profile.json`
- `sbm_manifest.sha256`

Manifest equality confirms deterministic integrity.

---

## C3. Why is randomness prohibited?

Randomness breaks replay identity.

SBM is **execution-deterministic and machine-independent.**

---

# SECTION D — Multi-Phase Deterministic Verification

## D1. What is the multi-phase verification system?

SBM implements three deterministic phases:

- Phase A — `digitsum_mod9` replay identity  
- Phase B — `xorshift_parity` replay identity  
- Phase C — capsule-level verification discipline  

Single-command orchestrator:

`verify\RUN_VERIFY_ALL_PHASES.cmd`

---

## D2. What defines success?

Success requires:

`PHASE_A_STATUS: PASS`  
`PHASE_B_STATUS: PASS`  
`PHASE_C_STATUS: PASS`  
`OVERALL_STATUS: PASS`  
`EXIT_CODE: 0`

Any failure forces deterministic exit.

---

## D3. What structural invariant governs replay?

`B_A = B_B`

Independent replays must produce byte-identical artifacts.

No tolerance windows permitted.

---

# SECTION E — What SBM Prevents

## E1. What problem does SBM solve?

Without structural discipline:

- Behavioral drift goes undetected  
- Alphabet instability propagates silently  
- Structural posture accumulates unbounded  
- Deterministic reproducibility weakens  

SBM enforces **deterministic structural observability.**

---

## E2. Does SBM predict outcomes?

No.

SBM classifies structural behavior.  
It does not forecast system futures.

---

# SECTION F — Cross-Domain Universality

## F1. Does SBM apply only to number theory?

No.

Any system with:

- Ordered evolution  
- Structural posture accumulation  
- Deterministic rule evaluation  

can be evaluated under SBM.

Examples demonstrated:

- `digitsum_mod9`
- `xorshift_parity`
- deterministic operator sweeps
- plateau-to-LCG transitions

All satisfy:

`phi((m,a,s)) = m`  
`B_A = B_B`

---

## F2. Has SBM been replay-verified?

Yes.

Demonstrated across:

- Multi-million sample runs  
- Independent replay bundles  
- Cross-phase orchestration  
- Structural freeze certification  

Determinism is demonstrated — not assumed.

---

# SECTION G — Scope & Non-Claims

## G1. What SBM does NOT claim

SBM does not:

- Predict failure  
- Replace classical mathematics  
- Inject optimization  
- Use probability  
- Guarantee domain-specific outcomes  

It governs deterministic structural behavior only.

---

## G2. Is SBM a safety certification?

No.

“Civilization-grade” refers strictly to deterministic verification discipline:

- Structural freeze boundary  
- Replay identity enforcement  
- Hash-certified core  
- Multi-phase verification  

Independent regulatory certification is required for safety-critical deployment.

---

# SECTION H — Architectural Summary

Layered view:

Classical Layer → Magnitude computation  
Structural Layer → Alignment and posture  
Alphabet Layer → Deterministic state transitions  
Verification Layer → Replay identity enforcement  

All collapse through:

`phi((m,a,s)) = m`

Magnitude remains primary.  
Structure becomes observable.  
Replay becomes enforceable.  
Determinism becomes certified.

---

# ONE-LINE SUMMARY

**Shunyaya Behavioral Mathematics (SBM)** introduces a deterministic structural alphabet discipline over ordered system evolution, preserving classical magnitude exactly via `phi((m,a,s)) = m` while enforcing bounded-horizon, replay-verifiable structural conformance under the invariant `B_A = B_B`.
