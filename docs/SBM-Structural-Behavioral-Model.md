# ⭐ SBM Structural Behavioral Model

**Deterministic Structural Behavioral Mathematics Framework**  
**No Probability • No Randomness • No Equation Modification**

---

# 1. Scope

This document defines the formal structural behavioral model used by **Shunyaya Behavioral Mathematics (SBM)**.

It specifies:

- **Deterministic structural state computation**
- **Bounded horizon evaluation**
- **Structural posture accumulation**
- **Deterministic alphabet transition discipline**
- **Replay identity guarantees**

It does not describe physical laws.  
It does not introduce predictive modeling.

It defines **structural behavioral topology only.**

---

# 2. Classical Preservation

SBM preserves classical magnitude exactly.

**Core invariant:**

`phi((m,a,s)) = m`

**Requirements:**

- Measured magnitude `m` is never altered  
- Domain equations remain untouched  
- No reinterpretation of classical law occurs  

Structural classification is observational only.

---

# 3. Structural State Definition

For ordered observations at tick `t`, define:

`X(t) = (m(t), a(t), s(t))`

Where:

- `m(t)` — classical magnitude  
- `a(t)` — structural alignment  
- `s(t)` — accumulated structural posture  

**Properties:**

- Finite  
- Deterministic  
- Replay-verifiable  

No probabilistic estimation occurs.  
No adaptive mutation is permitted.

---

# 4. Deterministic Structural Quantities

Structural evolution is defined via bounded deterministic update rules.

At each tick:

**Alignment evolution**

`a(t)` derived from bounded window behavior

**Posture accumulation**

`s(t)` updated deterministically from prior state

All structural differences are window-bound:

`dA(t) = a(t) - a(t-1)`  
`dS(t) = s(t) - s(t-1)`

**Properties:**

- Deterministic  
- Bounded  
- Replay-stable  

There is:

- **No confidence scoring**
- **No probabilistic blending**
- **No adaptive threshold tuning**

---

# 5. Bounded Horizon Model

Define a finite structural horizon:

`H >= 1`

Window definition:

`W_H(t) = {t-H+1, ..., t}`

All structural evaluations must be derived solely from `W_H(t)`.

**Properties:**

- Finite memory  
- No infinite accumulation  
- No forward forecasting  
- No adaptive window resizing  

Structural behavior is evaluated locally in time.

---

# 6. Structural Alphabet Discipline

SBM generates a deterministic structural alphabet representing behavioral transitions.

`Sigma = {sigma_0, ..., sigma_L}`

**Alphabet properties:**

- Finite  
- Closed under deterministic rules  
- Replay-stable  
- Operator-defined  

There is:

- **No runtime alphabet expansion**
- **No stochastic blending**
- **No adaptive vocabulary injection**

Alphabet growth invalidates conformance.

---

# 7. Structural Transition Determinism

At each tick, structural transition must be:

- Deterministic  
- Function of `(m,a,s)` and declared parameters  
- Reproducible under identical inputs  

Transition discipline must be:

- Total  
- Non-probabilistic  
- Window-bound  

Nondeterministic transition invalidates conformance.

---

# 8. Behavioral Classification

SBM classifies structural posture states through deterministic alphabet mapping.

Classification must satisfy:

- Finite state vocabulary  
- Replay identity  
- No dynamic state injection  
- No probabilistic arbitration  

Structural state must remain bounded and explicitly defined.

---

# 9. Multi-Phase Deterministic Validation

SBM structural validity is demonstrated through:

- Phase A — deterministic replay identity  
- Phase B — large-scale replay identity  
- Phase C — capsule verification discipline  

Single-command orchestration must produce:

`PHASE_A_STATUS: PASS`  
`PHASE_B_STATUS: PASS`  
`PHASE_C_STATUS: PASS`  
`OVERALL_STATUS: PASS`  
`EXIT_CODE: 0`

Replay equivalence condition:

`B_A = B_B`

Determinism is validated through replay identity and hash verification.

---

# 10. Structural Freeze Boundary

A certified SBM release must define a deterministic freeze boundary including:

- `scripts/`
- `verify/`
- `reference_outputs/`
- `release_phasec/`

The top-level `outputs/` directory and all presentation materials (`docs/`, `README`, diagrams, visualization layer) are intentionally excluded from the structural freeze boundary.

A structural hash must certify the frozen boundary.

Modification inside the frozen boundary invalidates certification.

Presentation materials may evolve independently without affecting deterministic conformance.

---

# 11. Conservative Behavioral Governance Principle

SBM is a **conservative structural overlay.**

It:

- Does not replace classical mathematics  
- Does not alter magnitude  
- Does not simulate stochastic dynamics  
- Does not introduce probabilistic models  
- Does not inject predictive control  

It governs structural observability only.

---

# 12. Cross-Domain Universality Condition

If a system provides:

- Ordered observable evolution  
- Deterministic parameter publication  
- Finite structural alphabet discipline  
- Replay identity enforcement  

Then SBM applies.

No domain-specific assumptions are required.

Structural invariants define applicability.

---

# 13. Non-Claims

The SBM Structural Behavioral Model does not:

- Predict failure  
- Forecast outcomes  
- Replace domain theory  
- Guarantee performance  
- Inject optimization  
- Modify classical equations  

It governs deterministic structural behavior only.

---

# Final Structural Statement

SBM behavioral governance is defined by:

**Conservative collapse invariant**

`phi((m,a,s)) = m`

**Deterministic bounded horizon**

`H`

**Finite structural alphabet**

`Sigma`

**Deterministic structural transitions**

**Multi-phase replay validation**

**Replay identity condition**

`B_A = B_B`

---

**Magnitude remains primary.**  
**Structure becomes observable.**  
**Execution becomes deterministic.**  
**Verification becomes replayable.**

**SBM structural discipline is formal — not interpretive.**
